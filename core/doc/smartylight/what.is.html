All compiled files are saved for faster loading on the next load.</li>		<li>Smarty-Light will also optionally save a cached version of templates, thus bypassing any compiling or execution, as it will load static pages precompiled and assembled, offering significant speed increases.</li>		<li>Smarty-Light supports config files and variables and will compile config files for speed, too!</li>	</ul>	Smarty-Light has a few disadvantages, though.	<ul>		<li>Smarty-Light does not have all the features of Smarty, such as pre/post/output filters, <code>include_php</code> tag, <code>section</code> tag, security features, and error handling.</li>		<li>Smarty-Light plugins and templates are not compatible with Smarty without at least a little modification.</li>		<li>Smarty-Light has no support for objects/classes. This was removed for speed. (Besides, classes in PHP4 are slow as hell to begin with.)</li>		<li>Smarty-Light has no support for template resources. This was removed for speed. (Besides, who wants to load a template from a database. That's also slow as hell.)</li>	</ul>	Smarty-Light was designed from the ground up to be fast. It has acheived that goal.</p><hr><h2><a name="credits">Credits</a></h2><p>What you see here is the work of <a href="http://www.paullockaby.com">Paul Lockaby.</a> However, while more than 75% of the code in this template engine has been rewritten, a bunch of that other 25% and a lot of organization has been directly derived from <a href="http://smarty.php.net">Smarty - the compiling PHP template engine for PHP</a>. Smarty template engine was originally programmed and is still maintained at the aforementioned website by Monte Ohrt and Andrei Zmievski.</p><hr><h2><a name="bugs">Bugs</a></h2><p>At the moment I know of no bugs. Usually when I find one, I squash it as soon as possible. Let me know if you find one and I'll fix it, too.</p><hr><h2><a name="todo">To Do</a></h2><p>These are things that I should have done before I released it, but that I put off to do until after I released the code.<ul>	<li>Comments inside of comments do not get parsed properly. (ex: <code>&lt;%* a comment &lt;%* another comment *%&gt; *%&gt;</code> will be displayed as <code>*%&gt;</code>)</li>	<li>Massively better error handling (read: there is none thus far).</li></ul></p><hr><h2><a name="history">History</a></h2><p><ul>	<li>January 17th, 2006 - Version 2.2.12		<ul>			<li>Fixed a typo in <tt>html_image</tt>. (Thanks to Michael Klein.)</li>			<li>Fixed a bug in <tt>clear</tt> that was a result of a typo.</li>			<li>Changed all attributes to lower case in the <tt>html_*</tt> plugins to compatible with XHTML. (Thanks to Michal Durys.)</li>			<li>Fixed a bug in <tt>html_checkbox</tt> and <tt>html_textbox</tt> that resulted in incorrect rendering of their HTML elements.</li>			<li>Fixed a bug in the handling of Samba paths on Windows servers. (Thanks to Ara Anjargolian.)</li>			<li>Updated some errors in the documentation.</li>			<li>Fixed a bug in <tt>html_options</tt> where there was a typo. (Thanks to Michael Klein.)</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>October 10th, 2005 - Version 2.2.11		<ul>			<li>Updated all of the plugins to follow a more standard code base and to properly escape strings before being passed to the template. (Thanks to Ara Anjargolian and Michael Klein.)</li>			<li>Fixed a bug in <tt>_rm_dir</tt> that prevented it from removing non-cache groups and compiled pages correctly.</li>			<li>Fixed a bug in <tt>_get_plugin_dir</tt> that referred to a hardcoded directory separator. (Thanks to Michael Klein.)</li>			<li>Fixed a warning in <tt>_build_dir</tt>. (Thanks to Michael Klein.)</li>			<li>Fixed a bug where error level reporting was being returned to normal prematurely. (Thanks to Axel.)</li>			<li>Changed the required stack from a numerical array to an associative array to avoid using <tt>array_unique</tt> in order to remove duplicate plugins from the list. (Thanks to Axel.)</li>			<li>Fixed a typo in <tt>_parse_function</tt> that would throw errors in some situations.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>August 7th, 2005 - Version 2.2.10		<ul>			<li>Updated documentation to fix errors in the documentation for <tt>count</tt>. (Thanks to Georg Gretz.)</li>			<li>Fixed a bug in <tt>_is_cached</tt> that would result in an error if cache groups were to be used. (Thanks to Hahl Laszlo and Michael Klein.)</li>			<li>Removed the 777 umask from the cache group builder. Folders created in the cache directory to represent cache groups will now use the same permissions as the parent directory.</li>			<li>Added the <tt>php</tt> tag to the compiler to allow for putting PHP directly into the template. To get to the variables assigned to the template, you can use the <tt>get_vars</tt> function to get variables from the PHP code. (Thanks to "Panama Jack".)		</ul>	</li>	<li>June 29, 2005 - Version 2.2.9		<ul>			<li>Fixed a bug in <tt>class.compile.php</tt> where <tt>assign</tt> didn't work. (Thanks to Georg Gretz.)</li>			<li>Updated documentation to actually refer to the <tt>count</tt> modifier.</li>			<li>Changed <tt>bbcode2html</tt> so that it uses &lt;pre&gt; to surround blocks of code.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>February 26, 2005 - Version 2.2.8		<ul>			<li>Changed the newline in each file back from \r\n to just \n, thus saving a few bytes and making it more "Unix"-like.</li>			<li>Fixed a bug where modifiers that didn't exist but began with a number ended up being concatenated to the end of the variable they were modifying.</li>			<li>Fixed bug in <tt>if-then</tt> statements where variables with a number in them were parsed incorrectly.</li>			<li>Fixed any known variable problems involving numbers in the variable name.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>February 14, 2005 - Version 2.2.7		<ul>			<li>Fixed a bug that fell into the place somewhere along the line that caused modifiers with digits in them to be parsed incorrectly.</li>			<li>Added <tt>html_hidden</tt> plugin.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>December 11, 2004 - Version 2.2.6		<ul>			<li>Fixed a bug where variables of 1 character were being misinterpreted as function calls and thus throwing errors when the function was not found. (Thanks to Ara Anjargolian.)</li>			<li>Added more special cases to <tt>if-then</tt> statements to accomodate for errors introduced in 2.2.5 and 2.2.4 with the template function changes. Specifically, the changes were adding the case-insensitive values "true", "false" and "null". (Thanks to Ara Anjargolian.)</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>October 30, 2004 - Version 2.2.5		<ul>			<li>Fixed a typo in the <tt>for</tt> function that resulted in the <tt>stop</tt> condition being changed if the <tt>step</tt> condition was not present.</li>			<li>Fixed a typo in the <tt>switch</tt> function that resulted in it not working at all. (Thanks to user ximian on the Yellow Duck forums.)</li>			<li>Template functions will not work in if-then statements. Almost all PHP functions will. Those that pass the <tt>function_exists</tt> test will, as well as <tt>empty</tt>, <tt>isset</tt>, and <tt>unset</tt>.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>October 15, 2004 - Version 2.2.4		<ul>			<li>Modifiers can now be placed on variables in if-then statements, but functions in if-then statements will now throw an error as they should not be used in this context. (Thanks to Jacquot Frederic.)</li>			<li>Added the values/output variables to <tt>html_options</tt>, as per the Smarty implementation of the same plugin. (Thanks to Ara Anjargolian.)</li>			<li>Fixed a bug in <tt>for</tt> that prevented the use of variables when assigning a starting and stopping point. (Thanks to Tim Green.)</li>			<li>Updated the template code to use the more compatible &lt;?php instead of &lt?. (Thanks to Pieter Claerhout.)</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>September 16, 2004 - Version 2.2.3		<ul>			<li>Fixed an bug in the <tt>_is_cached</tt> function that would result in incorrect cache usage.</li>			<li>Added the <tt>urlencode</tt> modifier to the standard distribution.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>August 3, 2004 - Version 2.2.2		<ul>			<li><font color="red">IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU CLEAN OUT YOUR COMPILE AND CACHE DIRECTORIES AFTER THIS UPGRADE!</font></li>			<li>Another error in _is_cached() is now resolved. (Thanks to Ara Anjargolian.)</li>			<li>Compiled and cached template MD5s are now stored with the full template directory path in them to allow for storing templates in different template directories. (Thanks to Pieter Claerhout.)</li>			<li>Compiled files are now prefixed with a 'c_' when saved to allow compiled and cached files to be stored in the same directory. (Thanks to Pieter Claerhout.)</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>July 31, 2004 - Version 2.2.1		<ul>			<li><font color="red">IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU CLEAN OUT YOUR COMPILE AND CACHE DIRECTORIES AFTER THIS UPGRADE!</font></li>			<li>My attempt at making cache files check included files for changes failed previously. Now it works.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>July 31, 2004 - Version 2.2.0		<ul>			<li><font color="red">IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU CLEAN OUT YOUR COMPILE AND CACHE DIRECTORIES AFTER THIS UPGRADE!</font></li>			<li>If a file was cached and had <code>includes</code> and the includes changed, the cached file wouldn't change. Now if an included file changes the cache will be regenerated.</li>			<li><font color="red">IMPORTANT!</FONT> Removed support for compile_ids. This is a big one as it changes the syntax of all calls to <code>display</code> and <code>fetch</code> and requires regeneration of all existing template files. (Thanks to Ara Anjargolian.)</li>			<li>Fixed a bug where in some cases, not having a trailing slash on your template directory name would result in an error when calling <code>is_cached</code>. (Thanks to Pieter Claerhout.)</li>			<li>Empty templates no longer generate an error.</li>			<li>PHP tags are now escaped so that you can create XML templates.</li>			<li><code>_get_dir</code> now correctly checks for a trailing slash using DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR instead of '/'. (Thanks to Pieter Claerhout.)</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>July 18, 2004 - Version 2.1.2		<ul>			<li>Fixed custom function parsing, which has apparently always been broken.</li>			<li>Paths now work in Windows. Didn't work because of a quoting bug. Now use single quotes instead of double quotes.</li>			<li>Can now pass an object method as a custom function/block/modifier.</li>			<li>Removed "compiler functions" because I think they're a pain to maintain.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>July 14, 2004 - Version 2.1.1		<ul>			<li>Fixed concatenation problems.</li>			<li>Implemented a new 'count' modifier that when used with the '@' will return the number of elements in the array it modifies.</li>			<li>Fixed plugin modifier routines to correctly map to arrays.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>February 7, 2004 - Version 2.1.0		<ul>			<li>Really fixed the <code>in_array</code> bug in <code>get_config_vars</code> this time. Honestly.</li>			<li>Fixed a bug where if a modifier was missing it would not give the name of the modifier missing but instead give some crap. Thanks to Ryan Johnson for catching this one.</li>			<li>Added the legacy option 'item' to <code>foreach</code> to make it more backwards compatible with Smarty.</li>			<li>Fixed the broken functionality of <code>$force_compile</code> as a result of the 2.0.0 release. :(</li>			<li>Fixed a bug in <code>class.config.php</code> that kept it from creating arrays if <code>$config_overwrite</code> was enabled and made appropriate changes to <code>class.template.php</code> to accomodate this change in the compilation step. This new fix requires PHP 4.2.0, however.</li>			<li>Made it such that if you have an array of config variables you can actually refer to them in your template using a similar syntax to an array of variables. They syntax looks like this: <code>#foo[$bar]#</code>.</li>			<li>Variables can no longer begin with an integer.</li>			<li>The following syntaxes actually work. <code>$foo[$bar]</code>, <code>$foo[#bar#]</code>, <code>#foo[0]#</code>, <code>#foo[$bar]#</code>, <code>#foo[#bar#]#</code>. Note that you cannot have <code>$foo[#bar[0]#]</code> or anything like that (i.e. an array in an array) because I don't think it can be done ad inifinitum. Anyone who thinks differently can submit some code.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>January 20, 2004 - Version 2.0.1		<ul>			<li>Fixed a bug with <code>for</code> that would cause it to not work at all.</li>			<li>Fixed a bug with <code>for</code> that required the <code>step</code> option. Now <code>step</code> defaults to '1'.</li>			<li>Changed <code>in_array</code> in <code>get_vars</code> and <code>get_config_vars</code> to <code>isset</code> because the former didn't seem to work, and I just noticed that.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>January 15, 2004 - Version 2.0.0		<ul>			<li>Fixed major bug with <code>clear_compiled</code> that would cause the script to not remove all compiled templates.</li>			<li>Added the following variables to be set by the user:				<ul>					<li><code>$cache</code> - if set to 'true', pages will be cached for speed.</li>					<li><code>$cache_dir</code> - where the cached files will be stored on the filesystem.</li>					<li><code>$cache_lifetime</code> - how old the cache can be before it gets flushed.</li>				</ul>			</li>			<li>Added the following functions for use by the user:				<ul>					<li><code>is_cached($file, $compile_id = null, $cache_id = null)</code> - will see if the specified file has a cached copy available.</li>					<li><code>clear_cached($file = null, $cache_id = null)</code> - will clear the cache for the specified file and cache id, or if neither are specified, the entire cache.</li>				</ul>			</li>			<li>Modified the following functions for use by the user:				<ul>					<li><code>display($file, $compile_id = null, $cache_id = null)</code> - now has the optional <code>$cache_id</code> parameter.</li>					<li><code>fetch($file, $compile_id = null, $cache_id = null)</cocde> - now has the optional <code>$cache_id</code> parameter.</li>				</ul>			</li>			<li>Caching was added for templates. Cache lifetimes are specified by the user for each template. Cache lifetimes are also inherited from the calling template, so if you use an <code>include</code>, the included file will have the same cache lifetime as the calling template. The default cache lifetime is zero seconds, which is the same as not having a cache.</li>			<li>Cache groups are handled in the same fashion as compile groups.</li>			<li>Inserts are not be cached and are fetched with each invocation of a cached template. Required a change to the compiler that would check to see if the the page was being cached and then store the insert data different. So basically, to copy the Smarty-Light people, I took an MD5 hash of 'Smarty-Light' (or was it 'smarty-light'... I can't remember) and surrounded the insert information in that and then replaced it using a built-in post-filter.</li>			<li>Rewrote <code>_rm_dir</code> and <code>_destroy_dir</code> and <code>clear_compiled</code> code to be a little cleaner and better (and in some cases actually work).</li>			<li>Removed "support" for running the installation without compilation. Support was spotty and I can't figure out why anyone would use it that way anyway.</li>			<li>Rewrote <code>fetch</code> code to handle caching, added a <code>_fetch_compiled</code> function, thus making it so that <code>fetch</code> only receives the completely compiled code, not each individual template. Also required a change in the compiler to implement this change.</code>			<li>Added a new <code>for</code> function that will loop through a block of code from <code>start</code> to <code>stop</code>, and skipping <code>step</code> integers each time. Identical in functionality to PHP's <code><a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.for.php">for</a></code> loops in PHP. An optional <code>value</code> argument will assign the current position of the foor loop to the variable specified (by way of <code>value=var</code>).</li>			<li>Fixed bug in compiler where a value of "0" was the same as an empty value.</li>			<li>Fixed a bug in <code>foreach</code> error checking.</li>			<li>Heavily modified the way <code>inserts</code> work in order to allow them to be non-cacheable.</li>			<li>Fixed the <code>plugin_dir</code> retrieval so that it will work via relative or absolute paths. For instance, if your plugin directory is a sub-directory of your bin directory then it will recognize that, but if it is somewhere else, it will also recognize that.</li>			<li>Fixed <code>config_load</code> compiling problems :\ where no quotes were put around strings and such.</li>			<li>Fixed a spacing bug that would insert stupid newlines all over the place, where they didn't belong.</li>			<li>Miscellaneous fixes and speed-ups here and there.</li>			<li>Reorganized and wrote some new documentation, though a lot of it was gleaned from documentation for Smarty.</li>			<li>Removed the <code>$display</code> parameter for <code>fetch</code> and instead just made <code>display</code> function echo the fetch return.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>December 14, 2003 - Version 1.1.16		<ul>			<li>Added a boolean option into <code>html_checkbox</code> so that if you pass "true" or "yes" or "on" as the <code>checked</code> value, it will be checked. Additionally, it will still be checked if <code>value</code> is equal to <code>checked</code>.</li>			<li>Fixed a bug with <code>class.config.php</code> that would read commented variables in.</li>			<li>Changed the method with which files are read in to use <code>file_get_contents</code> which is supposedly faster than using <code>fread</code>.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>July 27, 2003 - Version 1.1.15		<ul>			<li>Removed the <code>spacify</code> modifier from the distribution.</li>			<li>Updated the docs some more. They are basically done now, but I may make changes later to update them.</li>			<li>Included the docs with the distribution.</li>			<li>Modified a bunch of the <code>html_*</code> functions to be more standards complian (i.e. quotes around attribute values).</li>			<li>Modified <code>html_options</code> and removed the values and output attributes.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>July 25, 2003 - Version 1.1.14		<ul>			<li>Made <code>html_textbox</code> be HTML 4.01 Strict compatible</li>			<li>Fixed a bug in <code>class.config.php</code> that would mess up a config value if it contained a # (pound).</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>July 17, 2003 - Version 1.1.13		<ul>			<li>Fixed a bug with <code>elseif</code>.</li>			<li>Fixed a bug with assigning variables using the <code>assign</code> operator.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>July 15, 2003 - Version 1.1.12		<ul>			<li>Added <code>html_options</code> to plugins folder.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>July 14, 2003 - Version 1.1.11		<ul>			<li>Fixed incredibly stupid and embarrasing bug in <code>_run_insert</code> that prevented inserts from working at all. Way to go me for not testing them...</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>July 13, 2003 - Version 1.1.10		<ul>			<li>Fixed bug where compilation would crash if the the template file was empty.</li>			<li>Made it so that E_NOTICE errors will not come up during template execution.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>July 4, 2003 - Version 1.1.9		<ul>			<li>Added functions <code>assign_config</code> and <code>clear_config</code> to facilitate assigning configuration variables. I know that this defeats the purpose of configuration variables, but for my needs, I want it like this.</li>			<li>Fixed stupid bug in the assigning of an array of values, also added check to not allow for numeric variable names.</li>			<li>Fixed \$ bug in <code>foreach</code> compilation.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>July 3, 2003 - Version 1.1.8		<ul>			<li>Modified <code>class.template.php</code> and <code>class.compiler.php</code> to store the compile_id as a class variable.</li>			<li>Forced compiled included templates to be saved in the same compile id folder as the template that included them.</li>			<li>Fixed bug in <code>class.config.php</code> where it would read the first section in the file twice, once as the section name and once as the "globals" section. Fixed this by inserting a space at the beginning of the file after it is read into memory.</li>			<li>This time I actually put all of the necessary files into the zip file to be released. I don't know what was up with that!</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>July 2, 2003 - Version 1.1.7		<ul>			<li>Fixed bug where an error come up on E_ALL because a variable wasn't initiated.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>June 22, 2003 - Version 1.1.6		<ul>			<li>Changed the special _TPL vars from referencing $GLOBALS to referencing the $_ super-globals.</li>			<li>Fixed <code>include</code> so that it stored the included files inside of the same subdirectory as the original file in the compile directory.</li>			<li>Fixed the <code>_build_dir</code> code to not create any directories if <code>compile = false</code>.</li>			<li>Forced <code>clear_compiled</code> to exit without doing anything if <code>compile = false</code>.</li>			<li>Removed a debugging <code>echo</code> statement from <code>_rm_dir</code>.</li>			<li>Fixed bug in compilation and the compilation path of <code>config_load</code>.</li>			<li>Finished some more plugins, <code>capture</code>, <code>cycle</code>, <code>counter</code>, and <code>html_radio</code>.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>June 22, 2003 - Version 1.1.5		<ul>			<li>Removed support in config files for single quotes around values. Can still use double quotes and keywords like true/false, yes/no, and on/off</li>			<li>Changed modifiers back to the <code>tpl_</code> syntax so as to avoid confusion regarding any support for Smarty modifiers.</li>			<li>Moved _syntax_error *back* to <code>class.template.php</code> and renamed it to 'trigger_error'</li>			<li>Wrote a bunch of new and copied a bunch existing Smarty plugins to be included with the Smarty-Light distribution.</li>			<li>Fixed multiple bugs with the modifier usage and plugin inclusion.</li>			<li>Updated documentation to include a tiny bit more information on config files, functions, and modifiers. Documentation is still sparse.</li>			<li>Took <code>config_load</code> and put it into <code>class.compiler.php</code> instead of in the plugins folder.</li>			<li>Wrote in three new functions to allow for compile groups to be made. Also will allow for cache groups to be made when the time comes.</li>			<li>Moved the compile object into a class-variable instead of a function variable, to execution speed on multiple display/fetch calls.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>June 20, 2003 - Version 1.1.4		<ul>			<li>Included a bunch of plugins with the distribution.</li>			<li>Retracted claim of full support for Smarty plugins.</li>			<li>Added support for config files, config vars and included the config_load function in <code>class.template.php</code></li>		</ul>	</li> 	<li>June 18, 2003 - Version 1.1.3		<ul>			<li>Changed plugin nomenclature to be entirely compatible with Smarty. This means that modifier, function, block, and compiler plugins written for Smarty can be used with Smarty-Light.</li>			<li>Fixed a bug in _run_modifier and _parse_modifier.</li>			<li>Added a _require_stack variable into the compiler so that files that need to be included will be included dynamically and automatically. This also puts more of the error-checking into class.compiler.php, that is when I begin writing error-checking routines.</li>			<li>Added a regular expression into the compiler that will remove all unncessary opening and closing PHP tags.</li>			<li>Fixed a bug in _compile_arguments</li>			<li>Added 'force_compile' option (mostly for my testing :)</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>June 17, 2003 - Version 1.1.2		<ul>			<li>Fixed some embarrassing bugs in the template compiler regarding modifiers and missing functions.				<ul>					<li>Made class compiler extend class template.</li>					<li>Removed modifier specific references to the _plugin_exists function.</li>				</ul>			</li>			<li>Updated documentation to include some comments on variable modifiers.</li>			<li>Allowed functions inside of IF-THEN statements.</li>			<li>Added to the TODO list, perhaps someday I'll begin taking off of it, who knows.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>June 16, 2003 - Version 1.1.1		<ul>			<li>Removed _syntax_error and _fatal_error from class.compiler.php</li>			<li>When the script doesn't find the specified template file, it will just die and say the name of the file it couldn't find.</li>			<li>Forced the compiler to check for the existence of plugins instead of the displayer (thus allowing me to remove _syntax_error from class.compiler.php).</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>June 15, 2003 - Version 1.1.0		<ul>			<li>Seperated the compiler from the displayer.</li>			<li>Add option to save compiled files. This coupled with the compiler seperation gives me a two to three times speed increase.</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>June 12, 2003 - Version 1.0.0		<ul>			<li>Initial release.</li>		</ul>	</li></ul></p><hr><a href="index.html">Home</a></body></html>
